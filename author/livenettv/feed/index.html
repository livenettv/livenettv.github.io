<h2>Live NetTV for PC</h2>
<p>As you all know Live NetTV is a native Android application and installing it on windows requires a special software called Android Emulator.</p>
<p>The installation is a piece of cake. Let me give you a quick glimpse. Install BlueStacks(The Famous Android Emulator), Download and install Live NetTV APK on PC.</p>
<p>Follow our guide to quickly complete the process. All Channels and Categories are supported in the platform as well.</p>
<h2>How to install Live NetTV on PC Windows</h2>
<p>The installation is easy since Live NetTV requires BlueStacks, Check if your system meets the <a href="https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003252646-What-are-BlueStacks-3-system-requirements-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStacks Minimum Requirements</a>. Getting on with the installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before we proceed to install BlueStacks. If you ever wonder why BlueStacks instead of other emulators? Here is the answer. BlueStacks is the only application that process and works well on any windows version without compatibility issues.</li>
<li>Download the <strong>BlueStacks.exe</strong> file by clicking <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>Like any other windows application, Install and <strong>Open</strong> the App.</li>
<li>Now that&#8217;s completed. Now Open the <strong>browser</strong> and Go to <a href="https://www.livenettv.wiki/">Live NetTV</a> to download the latest version.</li>
<li>Ensure that you have the latest version of the app to avoid any installation failures.</li>
<li>Now Open BlueStacks, On the Bottom-Right Corner, Click on the <strong>INSTALL APK</strong> button.</li>
<li>A pop-up window opens then navigate to the <strong>Downloads folder/directory</strong> and find the file Live NetTV.</li>
<li>Select the file and tap the <strong>OPEN</strong> button. The livenettv.apk file will begin to install.</li>
<li>The Live NetTV App will install in no time. A notification from BlueStacks will be sent saying &#8220;<strong>Live NetTV has been Installed</strong>&#8220;.</li>
<li>Now open and start streaming Live TV Channels now without any hassle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of our users have complained about TV Channels when played only displays sound but no video. The main reason behind is that the Video Codec on the device isn&#8217;t compatible with the online streams. <a href="https://www.livenettv.wiki/live-nettv-on-firestick/">Live NetTV Firestick</a> version is almost same and doesn&#8217;t take much of a space.</p>
<p>In order to overcome that error while playing streams. Here is the solution- &#8220;<a href="https://www.livenettvapk.net/error-fixed-no-video-only-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Video only Audio Error Fixed</a>&#8221; from the official site of Live NetTV. Thanks to them it was rectified easily.</p>
<p>Now enjoy streaming on a bigger display and watch free TV Channel streams online. Hope the above method was pretty easy to follow. Having any queries? Feel Free to comment below.</p>

Currently, the app has millions of users. Some of the Channels available are CBS, BTSport, Sky Sports, Amarin HD, FOX News, ABC News, Disney Channel etc.</p>
<p>Any device such as iPhone and iPad that runs on iOS won&#8217;t be able to use the app since it is under development. Yes, you heard it right. The <a href="https://www.livenettv.wiki/">Live NetTV App</a> on iOS isn&#8217;t available right now.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135" src="https://www.livenettv.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Live-NetTV-for-iOS.jpg" alt="Live NetTV for iOS" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.livenettv.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Live-NetTV-for-iOS.jpg 1920w, https://www.livenettv.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Live-NetTV-for-iOS-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.livenettv.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Live-NetTV-for-iOS-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.livenettv.wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Live-NetTV-for-iOS-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>Many of my users have asked, &#8220;When will be available?&#8221;. According to a confidential source, the Live NetTV team is under the process of building the iOS version of the app which might be released in the mid of next year. Yet, the source also said that &#8220;The App might not see the daylight&#8221; if the development isn&#8217;t successful.</p>
<p>We are pretty sure that if the app arrives on it will definitely become a massive hit among the apple community. Until then lets hope for the best. Why wait till the <a href="https://www.livenettv.wiki/">Live NetTV</a> arrives try our other installation on other various devices and platforms too.</p>
