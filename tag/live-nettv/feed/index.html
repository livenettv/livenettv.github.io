<h2>Live NetTV for PC</h2>
<p>As you all know Live NetTV is a native Android application and installing it on windows requires a special software called Android Emulator.</p>
<p>The installation is a piece of cake. Let me give you a quick glimpse. Install BlueStacks(The Famous Android Emulator), Download and install Live NetTV APK on PC.</p>
<p>Follow our guide to quickly complete the process. All Channels and Categories are supported in the platform as well.</p>
<h2>How to install Live NetTV on PC Windows</h2>
<p>The installation is easy since Live NetTV requires BlueStacks, Check if your system meets the <a href="https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003252646-What-are-BlueStacks-3-system-requirements-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStacks Minimum Requirements</a>. Getting on with the installation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before we proceed to install BlueStacks. If you ever wonder why BlueStacks instead of other emulators? Here is the answer. BlueStacks is the only application that process and works well on any windows version without compatibility issues.</li>
<li>Download the <strong>BlueStacks.exe</strong> file by clicking <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>Like any other windows application, Install and <strong>Open</strong> the App.</li>

<li>Now open and start streaming Live TV Channels now without any hassle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of our users have complained about TV Channels when played only displays sound but no video. The main reason behind is that the Video Codec on the device isn&#8217;t compatible with the online streams. <a href="https://www.livenettv.wiki/live-nettv-on-firestick/">Live NetTV Firestick</a> version is almost same and doesn&#8217;t take much of a space.</p>
<p>In order to overcome that error while playing streams.
